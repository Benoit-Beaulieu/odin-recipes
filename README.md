This repo is my attempt at completing the first project of the Odin Project's Foundation course path. 

The goal of the project is to practice all of the HTML knowledge that I've learned up to this point, to create a website detailing recipes.

By completing this project, I will have showcased my ability to navigate the Command Line, commit changes to Git, and code in HTML. 

Specifically, using HTML attributes to format paragraphs, headers, links, images, and text semantically.
